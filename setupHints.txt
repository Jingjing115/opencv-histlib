Setup hints

LINUX:
By default OpenCV install places shared libraries in a location where some Linux OS's do not check, 
so you may get: 
"error while loading shared libraries: libopencv_core.so.2.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"

To fix this problem run the following (or place in your .bashrc file)
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

/usr/local/lib is the default install location for install, but if you do not install you can find the built libraries here:
/path-to-build-files/OpenCV-2.2.0/lib

WINDOWS:
On Windows the project expects that you have the environment variable OPENCVDIR defined.  
This is the top level OpenCV directory (e.g. C:/OpenCV2.2/).  
In addition the PATH environment variable must include the directory of the debug and release libraries.  
(e.g. C:\OpenCV2.2\vs2008\bin\Release;C:\OpenCV2.2\vs2008\bin\Debug)
